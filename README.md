# Steal this website!

There's no point in spending time to create new websites when there's already a ton of websites that could do the job. Therefore, instead of wasting time creating your own, just steal this website, modify it (the html is really straightforward and easy to change) and publish it, then spend the time that would have taken you to build a new website working on some interesting projects!

Now, in an ideal world that would work perfectly but in this one some people might think less of your website if it has been copied. That's why I suggest:
- **No credit!** Don't credit me nor this repository
- **No github fork!** If the repository is forked a link will be attached to your repository pointing to this one. Instead of forking it just click on the `Use this template` button or download the repo locally and re-upload it.

Just make it your own, remove any traces of me or the fact that it comes from somewhere else and never look back.
